# ML_project
Before the developed the module  I have analysis the Data and  got meaningful insights . Developed  the  Hotel Booking Prediction machine learning module . In this project I have applied Multiple algorithm . such  as "Logistic Regression" ,"Naive Bayes","RandomForest","Decision Tree","KNN" with  95% accuracy .

     I have developed  the module using jupyter Notebook .
     firstly import  required libraries  such as "Pandas","Numpy","Seaborn","Matplotlib", and "plotly".
     
     Then import the Data , after that i have checked the data  any missing values/ null values , in that case i found lots  of missing values. then I have replaced missing values. after that the data clean then I started analyze the data and Visualised the data. for visualization and insights nformation  I created quention  and finding Answer in the Data and i got.
