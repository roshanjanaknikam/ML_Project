# ML_project
Before the developed the module  I have analysis the Data and  got meaningful insights . Developed  the  Hotel Booking Prediction machine learning module . In this project I have applied Multiple algorithm . such  as "Logistic Regression" ,"Naive Bayes","RandomForest","Decision Tree","KNN" with  95% accuracy .
 I have developed  the module using jupyter Notebook .
firstly import  required libraries  such as "Pandas","Numpy","Seaborn","Matplotlib", and "plotly".   
Then import the Data , after that i have checked the data  any missing values/ null values , in that case i found lots  of missing values. then I have replaced missing values. after that the data clean then I started analyze the data and Visualised the data. for visualization and insights nformation  I created quention  and finding Answer in the Data and i got.
After analysis the  data  then developed the moduled. for that i did  ***Feature selection using co-corelation*** then ***Feature Encoding***  then***Handling the outliers , seprate the independent and dependent feature*** then ***import sklearn***  then spliting the Data for train_size took 0.75 data.
I used first ***aLogistic regression algorithm*** and got 71% accuracy. and after that I  applied multiple algorithm, 
In ***Naive Bayes algorithm*** got 61% accuracy,
In ***Random Forest algorithm*** got 95% accuracy,
In ***Decision Tree algorithm*** got 94% accuracy.
In ***KNN*** algorithm also got 94% accuracy .
